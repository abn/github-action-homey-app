# GitHub Actions For Homey App Development

Composite GitHub Actions for Homey App Development

## Introduction

This repository contains composite GitHub Actions designed to streamline the
development workflow for Homey applications. These actions encapsulate common
tasks and simplify the process of building, testing, and deploying Homey apps.

### Why not use the official ones from Athom BV?

This comes down to personal choice, while the steps maintain parity to what the Athom version does,
these actions are written as composite actions instead of containers. Personally, it is just a bit
easier to work with.
